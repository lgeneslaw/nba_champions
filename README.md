nba_champions
=============

I have always wanted to see a webpage that shows all of the NBA finals matchups along with the rosters of those teams.
After struggling to find such a page, I used the Beautiful Soup library in python to create nbayears.py. This script
scrapes html tables from basketball-reference.com and prints a complete html page to stdout. The printed page shows
the complete roster (with per-game stats) of the teams that played each other in the finals for every NBA season.
