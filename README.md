nba_champions
=============

I have always wanted to see a webpage that shows all of the NBA finals matchups along with the rosters of those teams.
After struggling to find such a page, I used the Beautiful Soup library in python to create nbayears.py. This script
scrapes html tables from basketball-reference.com and prints a complete html page to stdout. The printed page is a 
compilation of all of the tables from basketball-reference.com
